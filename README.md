# Road-Accident-Dashboard
📊 Excited to share my latest Excel project on Road Accident Data and Casualties! 🚗💥

In this interactive Sales Dashboard, I've created a comprehensive view of road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. The objective was to provide valuable insights to clients and shed light on accident trends. Here's a glimpse of my approach:

🔍 Data Gathering & Cleaning:
I imported the CSV file and performed various activities such as applying filters, removing duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming the data into an easily analyzable format.

🔄 Data Processing:
To create trendlines for CY and PY casualties, I added Year and Month columns using the TEXT() function on the Date column.

📊 Data Analysis and Visualization ➡ Pivot Table with 📈 Insights Drawn:

⏳ Created Total Casualties Data using Pivot Table in Dashboard. 
 ⏳ Created a Doughnut chart to analyze the Total casualties & its percentage with respect to accident severity.
 ⏳ Consolidated similar type of vehicle type using Pivot Table analyze option.
⏳ Created a Doughnut chart to analyze the maximum casualties by Vehicle type, which was a Car.
⏳ Inserted different vehicle type icons through Illustration section and Created a data of Total casualties with respect to Vehicle Type in Dashboard.
 ⏳ Created a Combo 2-D line chart to understand the Monthly trend representing comparison of casualties for CY and PY.
 ⏳ Created a Bar Chart to know the maximum casualties by Road Type.
 ⏳ Consolidated similar type of Road surface condition and Created a Treemap chart to understand the Distribution of total casualties through types of Road Surface.
 ⏳ Consolidated similar Light condition and Created doughnut chart to understand the relation b/w casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night. 

🔍 Enhanced Functionality:
I added filter panels and established connections to all the required pivot tables. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to necessary icons for seamless navigation and created a Data analysis sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to ease their work and gathered information.
